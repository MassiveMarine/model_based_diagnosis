  <description brief="Diagnosis Repair Engine repairs the faulty components by using planner and action servers">

This package provides planner based repair action server. It uses Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL) based planner that makes a plan for the action by using a domain and problem file. Repair Engine gets diagnosis from diagnosis engine and observations from observers and generates a problem file for the planner. Planner using domain and problem files, generates a set of action plans. Based on action plans repair engine invokes appropriate action server to stop/start a software node or shut-down/power-up a hardware device.
